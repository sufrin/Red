* Branch Version_1.0

  * Fully-functioning.
  
  * Branched from main to mark the start of an experiment
    in using RedScript to read profile/bindings.

    It's my intention to carry forward any non-profile changes
    made on `main` to `Version_1.0`.

* Tag Version_1.09

  * Fully functioning with RedScript configuration

  * Key-map construction-notation enables a single
    keyboard handler to supplant the previous `orElse`ed
    chain of handlers.

  * `Red` invokes `RedScript` functions defined in the bindings script to
    populate its various menus.

    `RedScript` functions defined in the bindings script have
    access to `SessionCommands` (mostly known by their name).
