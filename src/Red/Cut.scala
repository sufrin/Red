/** Representation of text that has been cut/deleted/copied in an editing

  * mark when this `Cut` was made. The intention is that when pasting a `Cut`
  * the cursor and mark end up at the correct ends of the pasted characters,
  * thereby allowing a cut action to be undone immediately by a paste of what
  * was cut, and a paste action to be undone immediately by a cut of the
  * selection.
  *
  * '''Incidentals'''
  *
  * The `generation` is the value of the generation of the document before the
  * cut was taken.
  *
  * The `cursor` is value of the session cursor at the moment the `Cut` was
  * constructed. Some cuts can safely be merged, namely adjacent cuts made from
  * successive generations of the document.
