  * `lineCount` is an initial size for the (expandable) line lineIndex.
  *
  *  The present module is a component (corresponding to his `Text`)
  *  of a refactoring and redesign of Mike Spivey's

  * "For present purposes, we count each newline character as part of the
  * line it terminates, so that every line has non-zero extent.  Let's
  * also imagine that a special terminator character is added to the end of
  * the characters, so that the very last line also has non-zero extent.  For an
  * ordinary characters file that ends in a newline, this last line will be empty
  * and be counted as having extent 1, and the editor will count the
  * file as having one more line than there are newline characters."
  * (J.M.Spivey, 2015)
  *
  * In this implementation, Spivey's "special" character is no longer
  * imaginary: it is represented explicitly as `END`, a character
  * that will never appear in `characters`.
