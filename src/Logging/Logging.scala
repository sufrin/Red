    *
    * {{{
    *   if (logging) finer(...)
    *   if (logging) info(...)
    * }}}
    *
    * If a (companion) object `KLARSE` is declared to extend
    * {{{    Logging.Loggable}}}
    * its own specific `Logger` is constructed, also named `"KLARSE"`
    * whose initial level is by default `WARN` but can be specified by a system
    * property
    * {{{    KLARSE.level}}}
    * at the start of  the `scala` run of the program.
    *
    * The class itself should
    * {{{    import KLARSE._}}}
    * so that the various logging methods are in scope.
    *
    * Logger messages are written by the method
    * {{{    KLARSE.writeLogMessage: LogMessage=>Unit }}}
    * whose default value writes suitably-formatted messages to the
    * console error stream. This may be overridden as the `Loggable`
    * companion object is constructed.
    *
    * Here's a small example
    * {{{
    *  class LogEg {
    *  import LogEg._
    *  def foo(x: String): Unit = if (logging) info(s"foo(\$x)")
    * }
    *
    * object LogEg extends Logging.Loggable
    * }}}
    *
    * Notice that the class imports everything from its companion object
    * though it need only inherit `logging`, and `info` here.
    *
    * The logging level for objects can be set
    * in several ways.
    *
    * As a (Java) property at the scala command line, with (eg)
    * {{{
    *   scala -DLogEg.level=FINEST ....
    * }}}
    *
    * or an assignment (in the program) of the form
    *
    * {{{
    *   LogEg.level = Logging.NONE
    * }}}
    *
    * Or symbolically, while the program is running, with
    * (eg) a call of the form
    * {{{
    *   Logging("LogEg") = "ALL"
    * }}}
    *
    * The integration of string matching into the `match` construct means that
    * the latter can easily be done while processing the arguments of a
    * command-line program.
    *
    * For example: here's part of an editing program:
    * {{{
    *   def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    *       for { arg <- args }
    *         arg match
    *         {  case s"-l\${module}=\${level}" => Logging.update(module, level)
    *            case _                       => editTheFile(arg)
    *         }
    * }}}
    *
    * But you don't need to declare any `Loggable` entities to
    * do some elementary logging. `Logging.Default` is predefined as a `Loggable`
    * object  whose methods can be used directly, and whose default
    * initial level, unless set as a system property, is `ALL`.
    *
    * {{{
    *   import Logging.Default._
    *   ...
    *   if (logging) warn("We are logging directly, using the default log")
    *   if (logging) trace(s"We are logging directly, using the default log")
