\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\texttt{Red} (also known as \texttt{AppleRed}) is an efficient,
no-frills \emph{unicode-capable} mode-free (and colourless) text editor
with a simple implementation and user interface that can be customized
using the \texttt{redscript} language (a Lisp-like notation). Its
underlying capabilities can extended straightforwardly using
\texttt{scala}. It has no pretensions to being an all-encompassing
workplace, and unlike many IDEs and modern editors does not confuse its
user by \emph{spontaneously} trying to be helpful: everything it does it
does in response to user input from mouse, pad, or keyboard.

\hypertarget{unicode}{%
\subsection{Unicode}\label{unicode}}

\texttt{Red} comes equipped with configuration facilities that make
working with a wide range of unicode characters straightforward.
Configurations may include mnemonic abbreviations for character
sequences that include unicode symbols. For example (material to the
right of \# is a comment):

\begin{verbatim}
    UI:abbrev  "exists"    "\u2203"  # ∃
    UI:abbrev  "notexists" "\u2204"  # ∄
    UI:abbrev  "~∃"        "\u2204"  # ∄
    UI:abbrev  "in"        "\u2208"  # ∈
    UI:abbrev  "notin"     "\u2190"  # ∉
    UI:abbrev  "<-"        "\u2190"  # ←
 
    UI:abbrev "lb"         "pound"
    UI:abbrev "lbs"        "pounds and pounds"
\end{verbatim}

When the abbrev key (often \texttt{ESC}) is pressed at the right of a
mnemonic in text, that mnemonic is replaced by the corresponding
character (sequence).

They may also bind specific keystrokes to actions that insert character
sequences that include unicode symbols. For example, this
(perhaps-eccentric) declaration binds \texttt{ALT}, and
\texttt{ALT-SHIFT} of the up, down, left, and right keys to various
unicode arrows.

\begin{verbatim}
    (UI:keys
      ("LEFT(SA)"   ↦ (insert "⇐"))
      ("RIGHT(SA)"  ↦ (insert "⇒"))
      ("LEFT(A)"    ↦ (insert "←"))
      ("RIGHT(A)"   ↦ (insert "→"))
      ("UP(SA)"     ↦ (insert "⇑"))
      ("DOWN(SA)"   ↦ (insert "⇓"))
      ("UP(A)"      ↦ (insert "↑"))
      ("DOWN(A)"    ↦ (insert "↓"))
    )
\end{verbatim}

The following declarations bind \texttt{ALT} variants of some ordinary
keys to unicode characters.

\begin{verbatim}
    (ALTS: "," "←" "≤") # map ALT "," to "←" and ALT-SHIFT "," to "≤"
    (ALTS: "." "→" "≥")
    (ALTS: "1" "⇓" "⇑")
    (ALTS: "6" "↓" "↑")
    (ALTS: "7" "∧" "∨")
    (ALTS: "o" "∘" "•")
    (ALT:  "A" "∀")
    (ALT:  "E" "∃")
    (ALT:  "Z" "↯")
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{tex}{%
\subsection{Tex}\label{tex}}

\texttt{Red} was designed to work comfortably with Latex/Xelatex
manuscripts, and to that end implements single-click actions that make
the flow of work in producing, typesetting, and proofreading such
manuscripts straightforward. It also comes equipped with actions to
support convenient selection and motion of nested
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin}-\texttt{end} blocks.

\hypertarget{markdown}{%
\subsection{Markdown}\label{markdown}}

Markdown manuscripts are also straighforward to work with; though the
varieties of markdown-like manuscript languages and dialects means that
some local configuration \emph{\textbf{may be necessary}} in order to
work with a particular dialect.
