<h3>Important (TT22)</h3>
<b>
        Virtually all the material of this year's course
        is different from that of previous years.  A provisional (evolving)
        synopsis of the section headings taken from the foils appears
        alongside the lecture foils <a href="Lectures/synopsis.pdf">here</a>.
</b>


<p>
        Please feel free to draw any mistakes or errors of judgment to my
        attention as the course proceeds.  There is almost certainly more
        written material here than can be covered properly in lectures and
        tutorials in half a term without rushing.  The extra material is
        intended to provide reading for those interested in further study.

<h3>Lecture foils, Notes and Exercises</h3>
<p>
        <a href="Lectures">Here</a> are the lecture foils. At the end of
        each section of foils you will find copious notes, 
        and <b>a selection of exercises</b> intended to 
        challenge your understanding. The notes and exercises are
        hyperlinked to and from their home foils. Due to an infelicity
        in (my understanding of) pdflatex, the pdf sidebar table
        of contents may give you the impression that the suggested
        answers for tutorial discussion are present: 
        they are not -- but your tutors have them.
</p>       
<p>
        Files named <code>...-nup.pdf</code> are suitable for
        printing in landscape mode on A4 paper; though title pages
        are always full-size. The other <code>.pdf</code> files have
        intact cross-reference links and sidebar indexes. They are
        suitable for working with on a computer.
</p>
<p>       
        You are likely to find it easier to follow the live lectures and to make
        your own additional notes on the material if you bring a paper copy
        of the relevant foils to the lectures.  
</p>

<h2>Program source texts, and other resources</h2>
<p> <a href="Resources">Here</a> are the complete source texts 
    of a handful of the programs discussed in
    the case-study sections of the foils. They are accompanied by
    <tt>Makefile</tt>s to build them with. I have, in addition,
    provided Scala code discussed in some of the other lectures.
    In all cases the program texts are extracted by program from 
    the latex manuscripts of the documents/foils that explain them,
    so they are rarely very beautifully formatted, and almost never
    useable without reading the accompanying documents/foils. 
</p>

<h2>Tutorial Problems</h2>
<p>
Selected tutorial exercises appear at the end of each section of foils. 
</p>

<h3>Practical materials</h3>
<p>
       <a href="Practicals">Here</a> are the practical materials. Hints to
       demonstrators are in the (same) usual place in the Departmental
       filestore as the tutors' materials.
